# GraphGram
GraphGram is a tool that allows you to generate graphs from existing data, draw trendlines that take into account the uncertainties of the data, and calculate the coefficients of these trendlines along with their uncertainties. GraphGram has been developed particularly with IB students in mind, but other people can find it useful just as well.
